University Trier - Multivariate Statistics - Exercise 1

# Summary of the Plots
In this exercise we use Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 compaines data, we use the first 30 compaines key features and try to interpert the different plots.

# Chernoff-face plots:
Each variable is handled differently by Chernoff faces. Because the perceived value of the features on the faces varies, the method variables are mapped to the features should be carefully determined. The Chernoff faces method is a fun approach to visualize multivariate data. It can be used to find similarities between items, although it is not the most efficient or accurate method of doing so. we use other techniques such as spider plots, pie plots, correlation plot, and Heatmap plots for easier interpretation.
